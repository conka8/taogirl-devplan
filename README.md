# **TaoGirls Whitepaper (Draft)**

## **1. Vision**

TaoGirls empowers OnlyFans creators through a decentralized marketing and subscription ecosystem built on blockchain.
Our mission is to free creators from exploitative agencies, giving them full ownership, transparency, and financial independence — while introducing a sustainable, profitable subnet within the Bittensor ecosystem.

## **2. Problem**

Many creators in the adult content industry face:

* **Restrictive agency contracts** taking 50%+ of earnings.
* **Lack of transparency** in marketing and promotion results.
* **Limited autonomy** over their content and revenue streams.
* **Stigma** and absence of ethical, decentralized alternatives.

---

## **3. Solution**

TaoGirls introduces a **Subnet-as-a-Service** model that merges decentralized marketing, staking-based subscriptions, and a sustainable business framework.

### **Core Components:**

* **OnlyFans Business Integration:**
  TaoGirls operates an independent premium OnlyFans agency, featuring verified top creators. Revenue from this business feeds into subnet buy-backs and marketing growth.

* **Subnet Marketing Agency:**
  The TaoGirls subnet acts as a transparent, decentralized marketing agency.

  * Creators can purchase marketing campaigns.
  * Miners (marketers) compete based on performance — *winner-takes-all* model ensures elite quality.
  * Transparent KPI tracking and feedback loops.

* **Subscription via Alpha Token Staking:**
  Users lock Alpha Tokens to gain premium access.

  * Locked = active subscription.
  * Unlock = subscription ends.
    This model promotes long-term staking, user retention, and token scarcity.
